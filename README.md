# Autonomous-Robot-Pathfinding-Simulator
Simulate the movement of an autonomous robot navigating a grid-based warehouse to find the optimal path from its current location to a target destination while avoiding obstacles. The project uses *A (A-star)**, a highly effective algorithm for real-time shortest-path calculations.
