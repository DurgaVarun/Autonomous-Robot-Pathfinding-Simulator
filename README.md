# Robot Pathfinding Simulator

This project is a visual simulator for robot pathfinding, implementing the A* algorithm. Users can interactively create a grid, set start and end points, add obstacles, and watch the algorithm find the shortest path in real-time.

## Introduction

The **Robot Pathfinding Simulator** demonstrates how autonomous robots navigate grids using the A* pathfinding algorithm. Users can interact with the grid to set the start and end points, place obstacles, and visualize the algorithm's step-by-step process, including visited nodes and the optimal path.

---

## Features

- Create a customizable grid for pathfinding simulation.
- Select starting and ending points for the path.
- Add obstacles to create complex environments.
- Visualize the A* algorithm in action:
  - Nodes explored are marked as **visited**.
  - The shortest path is highlighted after computation.
- Reset functionality to clear the grid and start over.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling for the grid and visual elements.
- **JavaScript**: Implementation of the A* algorithm and interactive features.
